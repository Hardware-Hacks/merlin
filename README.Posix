Note: "." refers to Merlin's base directory, i.e. /path/to/merlin. 

If you've followed the original setup outlined in README, you will have two
issues if you run Merlin with Arthur and graphing enabled on a POSIX system.

In particular,

1) The permissions on /var/www/.matplotlib and ./merlin/Arthur/graphs (777)
   are potentially insecure as they make these directories writeable for any
   user.
   
   To avoid confusion, "writable" means that any user can drop files into
   this directory, it DOES NOT mean that any user can randomly delete files
   from within this directory.
   
2) Clearing the graph cache at ./merlin/Arthur/graphs/* might fail because
   Apache (which serves Arthur) runs as a different user than excalibur.py,
   which should clear the cache upon running.

3) The suggested permissions (666) on the four logfiles are potentially
   insecure as they allow any user to overwrite these files.  
   
These issues can be addressed by implementing Access Control Lists (ACLs) in
the following fashion.

1) Make sure ACLs are enabled for your system. Usually, this requires mounting
   the filesystem in question with the "acl" option. See /etc/fstab. Also make
   sure ACL utilities are installed (e.g. "aptitude install acl" on Debian).

2) In the following, we will assume that excalibur.py and merlin.py are running
   as user "merlin" and that Apache is running as user "www-data".
   
3) Change permissions on on ./merlin/Arthur/graphs back to something sane, then
   add an ACL record for the Apache user.
   
   $ chown 755 ./merlin/Arthur/graphs
   $ setfacl -m u:www-data:rwx ./merlin/Arthur/graphs/
   
4) Any file created in the graphs directory will now be owned by "www-data". As
   such, the excalibur.py script (running as "merlin") will not be able to
   clear the cache. To rememdy this, add a default ACL record for "merlin" to
   any files created within this directory
   
   $ setfacl -d --set u:merlin:rwx ./merlin/Arthur/graphs/
   
5) Rinse and repeat for /var/www/.matplotlib, except that "merlin" has no need
   to delete this directory.
   
   $ chown 755 /var/www/.matplotlib
   $ setfacl -m u:www-data:rwx /var/www/.matplotlib
   
6) Last but not least, the logfiles. First of all, dumplog.txt and errorlog.txt
   need never be written to by any user other than "merlin". Therefore, do
   
   $ chmod 644 ./dumplog.txt
   $ chmod 644 ./errorlog.txt
   $ chmod 644 ./scanlog.txt
   
7) The logfile arthurlog.txt needs to be writable by "www-data". Again, using
   permissions 666 makes the file WORLD WRITABLE. Instead, set it to 644 and
   set up access for "www-data".
   
   $ chmod 644 ./arthurlog.txt
   $ setfacl -m u:www-data:rw- ./arthurlog.txt
   
That's it. You're done! Note that, if you follow this guide when already
running Merlin or Arthur, you should clean out the affected directories first.
